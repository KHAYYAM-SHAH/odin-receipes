        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>
            Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce..

        <h1>ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 cups shredded potato</li>

            <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>

            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>

            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>STEPS:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>

            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>

            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>

            <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>


        </ol>
